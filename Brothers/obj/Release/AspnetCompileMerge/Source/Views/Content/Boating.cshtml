        Recently Sikkim Provides Some Fine Opportunities For Boating. In <b>Aritar Lake</b> In East Sikkim These Lake Offer A Perfect Nature Retreat Because Of Their Seclusion. Renting A Boat For A Couple Of Hours And Heading Out To The Middle Or The Other Side Of The Lake Bordering The Forested Hill Can Be The Highlight Of A Warm Day. The Water Is Cleaner Out Far From The Buffalo And Washing On The Edge. Boats Can Also Be Had For The Whole Day, Or On An Hourly Basis. You Can Either Row Around Yourself Or Hire A Boatman, The Former Being Definitely A Better Option.
        At Aritar Is Fun Throughout The Year, Except During The Monsoon Months. However, The Best Time Is In The Winter Months Between October And February, When The Skies Are Clear And The Mountains Cast Their Shadows On The Lake's Waters.
