    <p>
        To "Trek" In The Himalayas Means To Set Off From A Given Town, Village Or Air Field And To Wonder Through Fields And Hamlets, Along Valleys And Streams Or Up Mountain Slopes To Any Altitude At One's Choice, But Usually Not Above 18,000 Ft. (5,500m) Trekking- Hiking Along The Trails That Form The Main Links Between Isolated Villages And Settlements Is One The Sikkim’s Main Attractions. The Word Trekking Was Almost Unheard Of In Sikkim Until The 70’s But Many Of Today's Visitors Came To Sikkim Solely To Trek.
