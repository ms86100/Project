        Sport Fishing, Like Hunting, Is Little Advertised And Therefore Little Known In Sikkim. However, For The Angling Enthusiast, Sikkim’s Rivers Can Prove Good Fishing Grounds. There Are Varieties Of Fresh-Water Fish In These Himalayan Waters, Ranging From The Much Sought After Mahseer To The Mountain Stream Trout-Like Varieties. The Best Season To Go Sport Fishing On White Waters Is Before And After The Monsoon From February Till April And October And November. During These Times The Fishes Go Upstream To Spawn And They Consume Less Food. But Locals Catch A Lot Of Fish During Monsoon As Well For Their Livelihood.
