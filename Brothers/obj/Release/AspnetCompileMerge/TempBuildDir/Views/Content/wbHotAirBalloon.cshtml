        So What If You Are Bit Scared To Paraglide, There Is Another Great Way To View Darjeeling And The Himalayan Snow Peaks From The Sky, And It's The Magnificent Hot Air Balloon!! You Will Be Sitting In A Basket Carrier Under The Canopy Of A Huge Brightly Colored Parachute And Gradually Lifted In The Air, Safely. Don't Worry, The Parachute Will Be Tied To The Ground With Ropes And There Will Be A Guide Accompanying You. The Balloon Is Filled With Hot Air From A Burner Fitted To It. As It Rises To 300-Ft Above The Ground, The Feeling And The View Around Is Awesome, And Will Remain As An Unforgettable Experience.
