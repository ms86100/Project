            In past, the natural beauty of Goa attracted a number of contenders, vying to rule over its fortunes. In effect, they gifted to it, some of its priceless monuments and a rich cultural heritage. The Bhija, Silahara and Kadamba rulers gifted a number of magnificent temples, while the Adil Shahi rulers left behind fine mosques and forts.

            Geographically divided into North and South, Goa has Panaji as its capital. In Panaji you can still find the Portuguese influence in its narrow cobbled streets, Latin villas, overhanging balconies and white washed churches. Nine km off Panaji is Old Goa, the old hub of Portugal's eastern empire. Here, in Old Goa, you can see the remains of this once magnificent city, in the form of half a dozen cathedrals and churches.
