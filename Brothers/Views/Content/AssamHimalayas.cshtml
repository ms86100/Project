        Assam Himalaya Is A Traditional Designation For The Portion Of The Himalaya Range Between The Eastern Border Of Bhutan, On The West, And The Great Bend Of The Tsangpo River, On The East. The Highest Peak Of This Range Is Namcha Barwa. Other High Peaks Include Gyala Peri, Sister Peak To Namcha Barwa; Kangto, And Nyegyi Kangsang. The Area Is Still Poorly Surveyed In General, And Little Visited By Outsiders.
        The Name "Assam Himalaya" Is Misleading, As Some Parts Of This Range Are In Southeastern Tibet, And Some Are In The Indian State Of Arunachal Pradesh. (Note: China Does Not Officially Recognize The Indian Claim To Arunachal Pradesh; However There Is A Well-Defined Line Of Control Which Has Been Stable For Some Time.) Assam Itself Is An Indian State Which Borders Arunachal Pradesh On The South.
