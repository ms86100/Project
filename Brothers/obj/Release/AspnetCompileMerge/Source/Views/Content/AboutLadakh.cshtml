            Ladakh lying in the greater Himalayas is bound to be cold. But interestingly enough this place has climatic variations which will leave you dumbfounded. Ladakh situated at an altitude of 3521m above sea level is a rugged mountainous town situated amidst barren mountains and a marked absence of life in the interiors of the these unnamed and unknown mountains.

        <h3><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-share-alt text-info"></i>&nbsp;People</h3>
        <p>
            The people of Ladakh bore much resemblance to Tibetans and Central Asians with their round faces, short stubby noses and small oblique eyes with pronounced cheekbones. The people of the mountains, they have good stamina are accustomed to manual labor. However, they are considered to be soft and plain at heart.

        <h3><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-share-alt text-info"></i>&nbsp;Religion</h3>
        <p>
            Ladakh was the conduit through which Buddhism reached Tibet from India and in the process it got deeply entrenched in the region from the very beginning. There are ancient Buddhist rock engravings all over the region, even in the areas like Dras and the lower Suru Valley which today are inhabited by an exclusively Muslim population.

        <h3><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-share-alt text-info"></i>&nbsp;Geography</h3>
        <p>
            The valley of Ladakh is situated at quite a high altitude, which varies from one place to the other. Infact, the geographical location of Ladakh ranges from 9,000 ft (2,750 m) high at Kargil to 25,170 ft (7,672m) high at Saser Kangri, in the Karakoram Range. Due to its high altitude, Ladakh experiences a very cold climate, where even the summer temperatures rarely exceed 27 deg C. Due to the high altitude of Ladakh the air is very thin and makes the heat of the sun very severe.
        </p>
        <p>
            As far as the geography of Leh Ladakh is concerned, the region abounds in physical beauty. Encircled by the Karakoram in the north and the Great Himalayas in the south, it presents a picturesque sight. Now a high-altitude desert, Ladakh was covered by an extensive lake system, at one point of time. The remnants of this system are still found on its southeast plateau of Rupshu and Chushul, in the drainage basins or lakes of Tso-moriri, Tso-kar and Pangong-tso. However, snowfall still remains the main source of water in Ladakh.

        <h3><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-share-alt text-info"></i>&nbsp;Economy</h3>
        <p>
            Livestock is one of the mainstays of Ladakh's domestic economy, with the yak and the goat being the two most important animals. Yaks are shaggy, short-statured, sturdy and sure footed animals of prodigious strength, capable of negotiating the steepest of slopes, narrow frozen tracks and the coldest of climes. Feeding on the snow and on small shrubs in the craggy terrain, they yield milk for butter, hair for ropes and tents, hide for boots, aprons and baskets, horns for agricultural implements, dung for fuel and meat for sustenance, thereby becoming the most important animal in the arctic zone.
            The goats of the eastern region of Chang Thang have extremely fine, long staple fleece, pashm famed for its end product of pashmina shawls. Its other products too help in the sustenance of daily life. Zanskari ponies are famous for their speed, strength and stamina and, therefore, make excellent vehicles of transport and are unequalled for the sport of Ladakhi polo.
