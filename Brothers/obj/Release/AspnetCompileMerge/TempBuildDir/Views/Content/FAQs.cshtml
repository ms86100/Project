                Yes, It's Possible For Foreigners To Get Legally Married In India. However, The Process Is Lengthy And Time Consuming, And You Should Allow To Spend Around 60 Days In The Country. As A Result, Many People Prefer To Take Care Of The Legal Part Of The Wedding At Home And Just Have The Wedding Ceremony In India.
                Goa And Rajasthan Are India’s Hottest Wedding Destinations – Goa For Its Beaches, And Rajasthan For Its Palaces.

            </p>
            <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
                There Are Many Ways To Get Around In This Vast Country. We Use Whichever Combination Of Travel Modes Best Suits Your Itinerary. Some Of These Are Listed Below:<br />
            </p>
            <b>Private Car With Driver</b>
            <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
                The Best Way To See India Is By Road — You Are Close To Life The Way The Locals Live It And You Will Have The Best Opportunities To Stop, Engage And Interact With The People As You Make Your Way Through Cities, Towns, Villages And Rural Landscapes. The Pace Of Travel On Our Tours Is Never Rushed — We Believe You Will See Far More, And Enjoy Yourself More, Taking Time To Properly Explore India Rather Than Rushing Through Merely Stopping At The 'Photo Op' Sites. India's Roads Are Quite Different From The West. The Highways And Byways Of The Country Are Far More Than Just A Way To Get From A To B — Life Itself Is On Display Along The Roadside. Travel Averages Around 40 Kilometers An Hour And We Tailor Our Tours To Include No More Than 6 Hours Driving In Any One Day, Unless It Is Unavoidable.
                We Value Our <b>Drivers</b> As They Add Many Levels To Your Travel Experience; They Pass On Feedback About Hotels, New Places Etc.
                They Are Not Licensed Guides And Cannot Take You Inside Monuments Or Temples To Give Detailed Explanations.
                It Is Usual For Drivers To Sleep In The Car, They Get An Overnight Allowance But Most Choose To Sleep In The Car Rather Than Take A Room.
                They Feel It Is A Good Security Cover For The Car And They Are Also Onsite If You Need Any Assistance.
                Various Types Of Vehicles Are Available — We Will Recommend The Appropriate One For The Number Of People Travelling In Your Party.
                Most Travel In India Runs Smoothly And With A Minimum Of Hassle For You. In The Unlikely Event Of Problems Occurring, Our Drivers Have Either A Mobile Phone Or Quick Access To Communication With Any Of Our Offices To Enable Difficulties To Be Overcome And Allow You To Get On With Your Holiday.
            </p>
            <b>Plane</b>
            <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
                Over The Past Few Years Budget Air Travel Has Emerged In India — This Is A Great Boon To The Visitor. Previously The Only Way To Cover Long Distances Was By Train Which Could Easily Eat Up Several Days Of Your Valuable Holiday Time. It Is Now Possible To Fly Between All The Major Places Of Interest With Ease, Meaning You Can Cover Several Parts Of The Country In A Shorter Period Of Time. This Does Not Necessarily Need To Be Expensive.
            </p>
            <b>Train</b>
            <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
                One Of The World's Largest Employers, Indian Railways Is More Than Just An Extremely Well Run Business — It Is Part Of The Lifeblood Of India. Train Travel Is Another Wonderful Option For Part Of Your Journey Through The Country. From The Famous Nilgiri Mountain Railway In Tamil Nadu To The Palace On Wheels In Rajasthan, The Diversity Of Rail Options Is A Great As That Of India Herself. If You Take An Overnight 'Sleeper' Journey, Bedding Is Provided.
            </p>
            <b>Auto Rickshaw</b>
            <p>
                The Ubiquitous Yellow And Black Auto Rickshaw (Or Just "Auto") Is As Much A Part Of The Life Of The Country As Cricket, Chapatti And Sadhus. Best Enjoyed Over Short Distances, Auto Travel Is A Sure Way To Get Close To Life On The Street In Any Town Or City. You May Have Almost As Much Fun Bargaining Over Your Fare As In The Actual Trip Itself.

            </p>
            <p>
                One Of The Ways In Which BROTHERS’ Will Help Make Your Trip To India Easier Is To Have Our Representatives Assist You To Make All Your Transfers.

                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-play">&nbsp;</span><b>DO THE INDIANS SPEAK ANY ENGLISH OR IS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TALK TO THEM?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Many People Speak English Especially In Big Cities And Tourist Towns. Some May Speak English Only A Little, But It Is One Of Their National Languages Along With Hindi. .In The Toursity Places The Drivers And Locals Will At Least Know Enough To Get You Around.
                If You Want To Make Friends With The Locals, Bring Perfume Samples For The Women! They Love Them!

            </p>
            <p>
                For Booking Use <b>Cleartrip & Cheapoair.Com</b> And For Travel Related Book Prefer <b>Lonely Planet</b>

            </p>
            <p>
                This Is Dependent Upon Your Chosen Itinerary In India, But Most Likely You’ll Enter Through Delhi, Kolkotta Or Bombay. Budget Airlines In India Are Incredible, So We Suggest To Book My Domestic Flight In India Separately.When Leaving India, Make Sure You Are Very Clear To Your Drive Which Airport To Go To. If You Take An Airport Taxi, Choose A Government Approved One. Not All Prepaid Taxis Are The Same.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-play">&nbsp;</span><b>HOW MUCH WILL I SPEND? I’M GOING FOR SIX MONTHS.WHAT EXTRA COSTS WILL I INCUR WHILE I AM IN INDIA?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                We Try To Make Our Tour Prices As 'Inclusive' As Possible So You Will Not Be Surprised With Extra 'Hidden' Costs As You Go Along. A Meal Can Cost Anything From USD 1 In A Roadside Eatery To USD 20+ In A Luxury Hotel. How Much You Will Spend Depends On Your Own Tastes Of Course, But If You Allow USD 3 Per Person For Lunches And USD 7, You Will Eat Very Well. Shopping In India Is Legendary And With Good Reason. Beautiful And Unique Handicrafts And Art Works Can Be Purchased From A Few Dollar Upwards, With Virtually No Upper Limit Provided You Are Willing To Pay For Items To Be Shipped Back To Your Home Address.
                You Can’t Think “Just Because It’s India Everywhere Is Cheap”. If You Want A True Vacation And Want To Live It Up, You Can Quickly Accidentally Spend As Much In Bombay As You Would In London.

                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-play">&nbsp;</span><b>WHERE SHOULD I GO AND WHAT ROUTE SHOULD I TAKE?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                You Have To Decide If You’re Here To Party, To Live In The City And Club Life, Or If You Want The “Spiritual” Route Or To The Touristy Place. You Chose The So-Called Spiritual One. Based On Your Interest And The Time We Would Suggest Few Options To Choose From. Great To Hear. Make Sure You Stay True To Yourself. Check Out An Ashram In Rishikesh. Do Vipasanna At A Quiet Location For Ten Days Of Meditation. Do Early Morning Yoga Every Day Every City You Stop In. Sunrise Hikes. Sunset Yoga. Take A Class To Learn Reiki, Yoga, Massage In The Mountains, Or Art In The Desert. Find Love In Goa! Go To Auroville And Live In A True Hippie Commune. Spend Time Exploring The Western Ghats.
                <br />
                But Most Of All, Realize That The Trip As A Whole Is What Makes It Life Changing. Have Fun With It! <b>India Will Change You Even If You Don’t Want It To</b>. You Could Go There And Not Have One Single Plan, But You’ll Eat Too Much, Pray At Hundreds Of Temples, And Probably Love Too!
                I Want A “Life-Changing”, Soul Searching Experience. I Want To Find Myself And Hear India Is The Place For That. Eat, Pray, Love!
            </p>

                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-play">&nbsp;</span><b>I’M NERVOUS I’LL GET SICK FROM THE FOOD OR GET MALARIA! WHAT MEDICINE SHOULD I BRING AND WHICH VACCINATIONS SHOULD I GET BEFORE DEPARTURE?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Staying Healthy In India Is Really Just A Matter Of Common Sense. Some People May Find That Their Body Takes A Few Days To Adjust To The Different Foods But Generally If You Observe A Few Simple Rules Like Only Drinking Bottled Water And Eating Freshly Cooked Foods You Will Probably Find That After A Short Time In India You Feel Better Than You Have In Years!
                <br />
                It’s Okay To Be Nervous Of The Food, But We Feel Like The Food Actually Made Few Feel Healthy And Anytime You Feel Sick We Feel That It’s Imported European Food.
                Of Course Be Careful With Street Drinks With Ice. If You’re Really Nervous, Just Know That Worst Case You Can Eat Rice, Bread, And Steamed Veggies If You’re On A Budget. If You’re Not On A Budget, You Don’t Have To Eat Indian Food At All If You Don’t Want To.
                Feel Free To Drink Juices From Restaurants, And Eat Raw Fruits And Veggies. Just Make Sure They Are Washed! You Can Ask Politely And You Won’t Offend Anyone.
                <b>All Indian Food Are Not Very Spicy</b>. India Is Justly Famous For Some Of The World's Best Food And Here You Can Enjoy It In All Its Glory. Food Hygiene Standards In Hotels And Resorts Are Now Near World Class And A Few Sensible Precautions Will Minimize Any Chance Of Getting Sick. As You Travel Around You Can Safely Eat At Small Local Restaurants Along The Way. If You Wish To Eat Chinese Or Continental Style Cuisine, This Is Available At Mid Range To Deluxe Hotels Throughout The Country.
                <br />
                We Say Though, This Is Our Opinion And It’s Differs Greatly.Vaccinations You Need To Consult Your Doctor. And Carry Own First-Aid Kit, Which Is Super Tiny. We Recommend To Have Health Insurance
                Recommended Vaccinations For Travel To India Include Hepatitis A/B And Tetanus. We Do Not Recommend Taking Malaria Medication — The Disease Is Now Virtually Non-Existent In Areas Tourists Will Visit — Sadly, The Same Cannot Be Said For Mosquitoes Which Are Still Widespread.

                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-play">&nbsp;</span><b>WHAT ABOUT TIPPING?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                From The Moment You Arrive You Will See That India Runs On Tipping, From The Person Who Carries Your Bag, Delivers Your Food Or Drives Your Vehicle. Wages Are Generally Very Low And Most People In Service Industries Make The Bulk Of Their Living By Tips. For A Room Boy Who Carries Your Bags To The Room A Few Cents Tip Is Fine. A Similar Amount Is OK For The Boys Who Come And Clean Your Room. In Restaurants Work On 10% And The Tip Will Be Reasonable. There Is No Set Amount As Is The Case In Other Countries.

            </p>
            <p>
                The Safest Way To Carry Your Tickets, Passport And Travelers Cheques Is In A Money Belt Worn Under Your Clothing. India Is Generally A Safe Place And You Would Be Extremely Unlucky To Have Anything Stolen. It Is Wise To Take Precautions And Always Be Alert. Small Amounts Of Money Can Be Carried In A Bum bag Or Shoulder Purse. This Ensures You Do Not Need To Pull Out A Pile Of A Small Purchase. All Hotel Rooms Have Secure Locks And Some People Prefer To Leave Their Suitcase Locked Inside The Room. For Air And Train Travel Your Bag Should Be Securely Locked. It Is A Good Idea To Carry A Photocopy Of Your Passport, Visa And Tickets And The Serial Numbers Of Your Traveler’s Cheques. If You Are Unlucky Enough To Lose Any Of These Valuable Items It Will Greatly Assist In Replacement.

                No, No, No, No! Sorry, Guys. There Are Drugs Like Everywhere Else In The World But You Need To Be Very Careful And Know That Even Though People Bribe Police, You Can’t Bank On That And You Could End Up In Prison. Like Any Country, They Are Illegal.

            </p>
            <p>
                Well You Got It Right. First Off, You Will Eat With Your Hands Sometimes. If There Is Silverware On The Table, Use It. If Not, Finger Food! Why Bother With Forks Or Chopsticks! Totally Unnecessary. <b>Use Your Right Hand. Your Clean Hand</b>.
                Ok, On To The Toilets: You Will See Western (Normal) Toilets Or Squat Ones. No Matter Which It Isn’t That Hard To Figure Out And You Won’t Think Much Of It Until You Get Sick To Your Stomach And Wish You Had Somewhere To Sit!
                Toilet Paper Access…. You’ll Have It Some Places Which Is Great But You Can’t Always Flush It- You Need To Throw It In The Trash. You Can Bring Wipes With You To Keep In Your Purse, Which Is What We Suggest, But Definitely On Trains And Buses For Late Night Stops. When You Have Neither Option, There Will Be One Of Two Things, A Water Hose To Spray Off, Or A Bucket And Tap. The Sprayer Is Genius And Actually Incredibly Clean Like Having A Shower. It’s What You Use At Home. <b>The Water Bucket Is The Worst</b>. You Will Fill It And Use Your Left Hand To Splash Water On Yourself. It’s Hard Sometimes To Get Use To. Always Wash Up After!

                The More U Turn Indian, The More U Wobble! It Means Yes, No, Maybe So,Or Maybe Not. Its So Funny And You’ll Probably Start Doing It Before You Even Understand It. You’ll Catch On To Gestures Before You Do Words. Eventually, You’ll Be Able To Tell The Subtle Differences Or Wobble For What The Person Is Saying, And Even If They Have A Little Bit Of Attitude!

                You’ll Be Able To Find An ATM Most Places You Won’t End Up In A Place With No Access To Cash, Unless The Atm Is Empty- Fresh Bills. We Suggest Take Out 200 USD At A Time. 10,000 Rs Is Usually The Max OnMost Of The ATM Withdrawal.

                India Has A Vast Range Of Climatic Conditions From Tropical In The South To Alpine In The North. Most Of The Country Outside The Himalaya Region Is At Its Best For Travel Between October And March. At This Time, Days Are Mild To Warm, Nights Comfortable And Rain (Expect In The South East) Is Very Rare. From April Onwards The Humidity Level Rises With The Temperatures And With The Onset Of The Monsoon In June Travel Can Be Difficult In Places. The Advantages Of Travel Outside The Peak Season Are Reduced Tariffs, And Fewer Tourists. At Virtually Any Time Of The Year, Some Part Of India Or Other Will Be Suitable To Visit.
                India Is Very Seasonal With The Monsoon In The South And The Snowy Road Closures Up North. Luckily These Happen At Opposite Times So You Can Plan Your Trip Better. You Should Try To Go At A Reasonable Time To Make The Best Of Your Trip, But If You Make A Mistake Or Go Somewhere “Off-Season”, It’s All Going To Be Okay. There Are Perks To Traveling Off Season.

            </p>
            <p>
                Making Friends In India As A Backpacker Is Not Like Europe. You Can’t Come Alone With The Expectation You Will Find Someone To Travel With.
                In India There Aren’t Hostels Like Europe, There Are Guesthouses, Which You Will Have A Room And Bathroom To Yourself. You Can Meet People In The Market Or At A Restaurant, Which Is Why Lonely Planet Guides Are Nice To Tell You Where The Tourists Are.
                When You See Someone That Looks Friendly, It Might Be The Only Backpacker You See For A Couple Days. You Need To Approach Them! You Won’t Make Friends Being An Introvert. If Someone Doesn’t Seem Interested In Chilling With You, Remember You Are In A Place That People Come Specifically To “Find Themselves” And All That, So They May Need Peace And Quiet.
