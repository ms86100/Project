        Trek In Sikkim Is A Unique And Unforgettable Experience For A Whole Lot Of Reasons But Four In Particular Stand Out
    </p>
    <h4 class="text-info">SCENERY</h4>
    <p>
        Out Of Highest Mountains In The World Is In Sikkim And If You Want To See These Up Close, You Must Walk. While Trekking You See Far More Than The Mountains. You Can Walk From The Tropical Lowlands To Alpine Meadows And Glacial Moraines While In The Spring Brilliant Rhododendrons Will Be In Bloom And You May See Rare Species Of Birds.
    </p>
    <h4 class="text-info">DIVERSITY</h4>
    <p>
        The Landscape Of Sikkim Is Almost Continually Inhabited. The Majority Of Sikkim Population Live, Not In The Town, But In Tiny Villages. Even In The High Mountains, Small Settlements On Stone Houses And Yak Pastures Dot Every Possible Flat Space. Much Of The Fascination Of A Trek Is Derived From The Opportunity To Observe Life In These Villages, Where People Truly Live Off The Land, Using Only A Few Manufactured Items Such As Soap, Kerosene, Paper And Matches. All Of Which Are Imported In Bamboo Baskets Carried By Bare Foot Porters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Trekkers Pass Through Picturesque Villages Inhabited By Bhutia's, Lepcha’s Sherpa’s, Gurungs And Tamangs In The Highlands And Brahmins & Chhetris In The Lower Altitudes. These Are Among The Many Ethnic Groups Which Exist In Sikkim.
    </p>
    <h4 class="text-info">PEOPLE</h4>
    <p>
        Trekkers Are Always Impressed By The Friendliness Of The People They Meet Along The Local Trails .The Hill People Particularly Their Traditional Hospitality And Fascinating Culture, Make A Trek In Sikkim A Special Kind Of Mountain Holiday Unlike Any Other Part Of World.
    </p>
    <h4 class="text-info">SAFETY</h4>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h4 class="text-info">HEIGHT</h4>
    <p>
        Trekking Is Not Mountaineering But It Is As Well To Remember That The Himalayas Begin Where Other Mountains Finish. Whether You Begin Your Trek At A Roadbed Into A Remote Mountain, A Large Part Of Your Trek Will Be In The Middle Hills Region At Moderate Elevations. Between 1000 Meters And 3000 Meters. Most Of The Time You Will Remain With In The Altitude Range 1500 To 2000 Meters. In This Region, There Are Always Well-Developed Trails Through Villages And Across Mountain Passes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So The Trails, Though Often Indistinct, Are Always There. All Trails Are Easily Traversed Without The Aid Of Ropes Or Any Mountaineering Skill.
        Techniques Are Almost Never Used On A Traditional Trek. Anyone Who Has Walked Extensively In The Mountains Has All The Skill Necessary For Trek In Sikkim.
