        Dooars Is One Of The Very Few Places Left In The Country Where Nature Is So Lavish Of Her Green Facilities. The Unending Stretch Of Virgin Forests Is Cress-Crossed By The River Teesta And Her Innumerable Tributaries.
        The Dooars Or Duars (In Bengali & Nepali) Are The Floodplains And Foothills Of The Eastern Himalayas In North-East India Around Bhutan. Duar Means Door In Nepali And Bengali Languages, And The Region Forms The Gateway To Bhutan From India.
        The Western Dooars Is Known As The Bengal Dooars And The Eastern Dooars As The Assam Dooars. The Dooars Valley (Also Called Duars) Stretching From The River Teesta On The West To The River Sankosh On The East Covers An Area Of Roughly 130 Km By 40 Km. The Dooars Forms Major Part Of The Jalpaiguri District.
        The Dooars Act As Doorways To Bhutan; Thus, The Export-Import Industry Also Flourishes In The Area. The Towns Of Jaigaon, Siliguri And Phuentsholing Are Important Hubs Of The Export-Import Industry.
