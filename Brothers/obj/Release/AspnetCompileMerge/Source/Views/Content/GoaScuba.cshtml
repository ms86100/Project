        Also, The State’s Coastline Has Several Coral Gardens To Dive, But Perhaps The Most Interesting Sites Are The Wrecks Of Ships Lost By The Portuguese During Their Colonial Period. Most Of The Dive Sites Are Situated Around Grand Island, But More Advanced Divers Should Consider Day Trips To Angria Bank, Often Carpeted In Starfish, Or Pigeon Island, Where It’s Common To Spot Sea Turtles And Barracuda.
