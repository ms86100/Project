        Of Whatever Is Known Of Nagaland’s Undocumented History, The State Was Initially Under The Cacharis Of Assam Who Had Established A Hindu State In Dimapur. The Naga Soldiers Were A Tremendous Boon For The Cacharis. Since Time Immemorial, The Nagas Have Made Great Soldiers Who Have Fought With An Independence And Valour Peculiar To Themselves. The Cachari Rulers With The Help Of The Nagas Would Occasionally Raid Assam And Myanmar. The British Colonialists, Between 1832 And 1879, Tried To Control The Nagas In Prolonged Battles. Peace Came Only In 1889. Kohima Was Under Siege In1943 During World War II When The Japanese Attacked. In The Battle For Kohima, 10,000 Allied Soldiers Lost Their Lives.

        After India’s Independence In 1947, Nagaland Began Its Movement For Autonomy. Unrest In The State Carried On Till November 1975 When The Naga Leaders Belonging Especially To The Angami, Zapu And Phizo Tribes And The Government Of India Reached An Agreement. However Sporadic Bursts Of Violence Keep Occurring Even Today. This Fiercely Independent State Holds On To Its Traditions, Values And Culture Despite Attempts At Modernization.
