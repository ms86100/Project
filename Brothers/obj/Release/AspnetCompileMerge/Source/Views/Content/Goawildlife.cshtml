        The Rivers And Coastal Waters Around The State Are Filled With Wildlife, And Taking A Boat Expedition Is A Great Way To Spot Some Of These Interesting Critters. Along The Mandovi River, You May Get Lucky Enough To See Crocodiles Or Freshwater Dolphins Swimming Near The Estuary. For Bird Watching, Pay A Visit To The Dr Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary, A 440-Acre (178-Hectacre) Mangrove Forest Near The Capital City Of Panaji (Panjim).
