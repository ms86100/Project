                        Pokhara Is One Of Nepal’s Most Idyllic Cities. Its Natural Beauty And Charm Continues To Inspire Poets And Songwriters For Many Years Now. The Mountains, Caves, Gorges, Rivers, And Lakes Have Been Poetically Linked To Wide Range Of State Of Human Emotions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In The Medieval Times Pokhara Served As An Important Transit On The Tibet-Indo Trade. Then, Caravan Of Mules Ferrying Highland Salt Reached The Town Of Pokhara On The Way To The Towns In The Indian Plains. Similarly, The Traders From South Ferried Grains And Cooking Oil Destined For The Arid Highlands. Over Time This Tradition Contributed Significantly To The Growth Of Pokhara.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prior To The Conquest Of Modern State Of Nepal, Kaski, The Area Surrounding Pokhara Valley, Was One Of The Important Principalities. Unfortunately, Only Few Archeological Remnants Of Those Times Have Survived Unlike The Historical Structures Of The Same Period In Patan, Kathmandu, And Bhaktapur.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Natural Beauty And Charm Makes Up For Pokhara’s Lack Of Sites Of Historical Significance. It Is Nepal’s Largest City From Where Three Of The Over 8000 Meters High Mountains Can Be Viewed At A Close Proximity For Almost Eight Months A Year. Rising From An Elevation Of 700-1100 Meters The Nature Gifted Caves, Lakes, Gorges, And Canyons Fascinates Any Nature Lover.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The People And Lifestyle Makes Pokhara More Incredible. Although Home To Gurungs And Magars, Two Indigenous Ethnic Peoples With A Gallant History, Pokhara’s Demographic Composition Also Speaks For Its Celebrated Multiculturalism And Diversity; Where Dalits And Brahmans, Muslims And Hindus, And Ethnic Tibetans And Christians Have Peacefully Existed For Over Half A Century. It Is Also Here That The Forces Of Modern Globalization Have Existed Side By Side An Age Old Cultural Tradition Firmly Grounded In The Medieval Past. Only A Short Hike Into The Villages Reveals The Simple Lifestyle That Has Sustained And Survived For Centuries.
                        Largely An Agrarian One Pokhara’s Economy In The Recent Times Has Diversified Into Services, Trade And Some Manufacturing. Tourism And Remittances From Foreign Employment Have Clearly Emerged As Lucrative Sectors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There Are Accounts Of Visits By Outsiders To Pokhara As Early As The Mid 1800s. However, The First Meaningful Contact With The Foreigners Began Only After The Kingdom Was Officially Opened In The Fifties. In The Early Days, Westerners Primarily Volunteered In And Around Pokhara Working Closely With The Communities In The Areas Of Health And Education. The Flower People Arrived In The 70s Paving The Way For Modern Tourism Springing Up Small Lodges And Teashops Along The South Bank Of The Lake. The Modern Era Of Tourism Began In The Late 80s After The Opening Of Acclaimed Trekking Routes Such As The Annapurna Sanctuary And Annapurna Circuit. Since Then, Large Hotels, Restaurants, Bars, Shops Selling Trekking Gears, Books, Souvenirs And Banks Have Opened To Cater About 200,000 Visitors Each Year.

                        Devi’s Or David’s Fall (Patalé Chango In Nepali) Is A Lovely Waterfall In The City’s Southern Edge. Legends Have It That A Lady By The Name Was Swept Into The Waterfall Never To Be Discovered Again. In Early Years Since The Waterfall Began To Attract Visitors, The Nearby Area Was Sparsely Populated And Much Of The Waterfall Site Was Unattended. In The Recent Years, The Conservation Efforts To Protect The Waterfall And Its Premises Are Underway. The Latest Facelift Around The Waterfall Is A Testimony Of Ongoing Conservation Initiative.

The Rushing Flow Of Water Through The Narrow Moraine Canyon Into The Deep Ground Hole Forms A Spectacular Site.
                    </p>

                        Just Across The Highway From The Devi’s Fall Is The Famous Gupteshwor Cave. This Underground Cavity Is Quite A Fascinating Occurrence For Its Close Proximity To The Waterfall. What Appears To Be A Narrow Entrance To The Cave Balloons Up Inside To Form A First Wide Platform Housing A Temple Of Lord Shiva. A Further Down The Stairs And Through A Narrow Passage Leads To The Main Cavity With High Walls Aligned Closed To Wet Stalagmites And Stalactites. About 25 Meters Beyond This Point Is The Main Drop Zone Of The Devi’s Waterfall After Sinking In The Ground. On Any Given Day This Underground Spectacle Is Fascinating For It Remained Profoundly Mysterious Until It Was Explored By The Locals.

                    <p>
                        The Charm Of Paragliding In Pokhara Lies In The Unique Geography, Weather Condition, And An Unsurpassed Intimacy With The Birds Of Prey, The Natural Thermal Guides That Have Inspired Paragliding’s Flying Principles.
                    </p>

                    <b>Live Music </b>
                    <p>
                        Many Of Pokhara’s Bars And Cafe Feature Western Style Live Music. The House Bands Generally Play Many Of The Popular Western Covers. The Focus Is Not On Any Particular Genre Thus No Cover Charges Apply. Live Music First Began By The Lakeside In The Mid Nineties. Then, Bands Usually Came In From Kathmandu And Even Far Away Darjeeling. Earlier Organized Initiatives To Promote Live Music In Lakeside Were The Maha Shivaratri International Music Festival And The Annual Lakeside Street Festival. Although These Events Have Ceased To Showcase They Played Immense Role In Bringing In International Music And Artists To Pokhara.

                    <p>
                        Traditional Ethnic Cultural Show Is A Lively Way To Spend The Evening With Friends Over Sumptuous Dinner And Drinks. Pokhara Valley And The Surrounding Is A Home To Some Of Nepal’s Most Hospitable And Culturally Rich Indigenous Ethnic People.

                    <h5>Places To Shop</h5>
                    <p>
                        Far From The Convenience And Sleekness Of Glitzy Malls, Shopping In Pokhara Is An Entirely Unique Indulgence. Pokhara’s Three Different Shopping Districts Provide Unmatched Perspective In Lifestyle From An Almost Medieval Old Bazaar That Still Enjoys The Status Of A Supply Lifeline To Many Villages And Towns, Burgeoning Modern City Center, And A Tourist Friendly Shopping At Lakeside.
                    </p>
                    <b>The Old Bazar</b>
                    <p>
                        The Narrow Lane From Bagar To Nalamukh In The Old Quarter Is Where Trade And Commerce Flourished First In Pokhara. Until Modern Urbanization Began Two Decades Ago, This Formed The Central Supplies Lifeline To Many Of Surrounding Villages And Faraway Towns Hitherto Untouched By Roads And Modern Means Of Communication. An Eclectic Mix Of Traders Including The Famed Newars, Thakalis, And Mustangis Traded Salt, Oil, Herbs, Utensils, Wool, Rugs, Grains, Spices, Condiments, Clothes, And Farming Tools. In The Medieval Period, Pokhara Also Served As A Transit In The Indo-Tibet Salt Trade Conduit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Old Bazar Houses Some Of Pokhara’s Oldest Buildings. These Buildings Are Still Inhabited And Preserved By Newar Families And Reflect Rich Architectural Aesthetics Of The Early Pokhara Period. Today, Many Of These Old Mud Brick And Tile Houses Are Rapidly Being Replaced By Modern Concrete Structures. Yet, The Charms Of The Trade Practices Have Successfully Survived In The Narrow Dark Compartments Of The Surviving Old Buildings. Many Shops Still Sell Goods Sold As Early As A Half A Century Ago. The Lifestyle Of The Old Bazaar In Itself Is A Unique Sight. One Can View Newar Sweet Makers Prepare Sun-Dried Delicacies, Traditional Ration Shops, Opulent Cloth And Craft Stores And Gaudy Jeweler Stores.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other Places Of Attraction In The Old Bazar Are The Shrine Of Bindabasini Mai And The Annual Dashain Chyangra Festival.
                        Things To Buy: Local Handicrafts And Pots, Traditional Spices, Woolen Rugs, Bridal Gold Ornaments
                    </p>
                    <b>Mahendrapul City Center</b>
                    <p>
                        Since Modern Urbanization Began Two Decades Ago, Mahendrapul And Chipledhunga Have Enjoyed The Status Of Being Pokhara’s Main City Center. The Expansion Of The City Center Market Is A Testimony Of Pokhara’s Evolution From A Medieval Trading Town To A Sprawling Modern City; A Shift From An Agricultural Subsistent Economy To An Increasingly Consumer One. Today, The City Center Is Dotted With Modern Department Stores And Shopping Centers Selling Everything From Imported Garments To Latest Mobile Phones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The City Center Is The Busiest And Often Crammed With Insurmountable Street Vendors Selling Seasonal Fruits And Vegetables, Spices And Condiments, Inexpensive Chinese Garments And Pirated Dvds. These Operate Side By Side Swanky Glazed Air-Conditioned Stores, Cyber Cafés, And Restaurants. The Traditional North Indian Style Large Open Clothing Stores Add To The Color And Vibrancy Of The City Center. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In The Last 5 Years, The Market Has Extended Southwards From The Chipledhunga Roundabout To What Is Popularly Known As Newroad. Over 40 Commercial Banks And Financial Institutions Dot The Either Side Of This Wide Street Stretch.   
                    </p>
                    <b>Lakeside</b>
                    <p>
                        The Hundreds Of Shops At Either Side Of The Lakeside Street Stretch Is An Excellent Place To Bargain And Shop. Since The First Tourist Friendly Shops Sprang Up On Tiny Stalls Twenty Years Ago, Shopping Here Has Really Come Off Age. A Large Majority Of Shops Sell Trekking Related Goods. Others Sell Books, Maps, Cds, Thankas, Embroidered Clothing, Tibetan Antiques, Gems And Stones, Silk, Rugs, Cameras And Films, And Anything One Can Possibly Ask For. The Traders Come From Everywhere Including Kashmir, Tibet, China, Europe, And Kathmandu.

                        <p>If Visitors Are Wondering Which Place In This Kingdom Would Give Them A Taste Of Everything, We Suggest That They Give Tansen A Try. Tansen Is A Small Town Of Approximately Twenty Thousand People. It Is On The Way From Pokhara To Lumbini, The Birthplace Of Lord Buddha, And It Is Not Too Far From The Royal Chitwan National Park. Located 4,300 Meters Above Sea Level, On The South Flank Of Srinagar Hill, The Greatest Attractions Of This Town Are Its Ancient Culture, Friendly People, Excellent Mountain Views, And, Above All, Its Serene Atmosphere. The Weather Remains Moderate Throughout The Year, And It Is A Pleasant Place To Visit In Any Season.</p>

                    <p>
                        The Town's Mostly Newar And Magar Inhabitants Have Long Been Known As Staunch Warriors. The Kings Of Tansen Wielded Great Power Over Western Nepal In The Fifteenth Century. Palpa, Their Kingdom Was The Last To Be Defeated By The Conquering Gurkhas Who Unified Today's Nepal. These People Became Even More Famous In The Anglo-Nepal War Of The Early 1800s. Col. Ujir Singh Thapa Who Commanded The Army In The Region Was In An Extremely Trying Situation At The Time. His Men Were Outnumbered Four To One By The English Forces. He Desperately Asked For Divine Help Before Going Into Battle, Promising A Temple In The Name Of Goddess Bhagwati (Who Is Ferocious And Loves Blood Sacrifices) If She Would Help Him. He Won. In 1815, He Kept His Word And Built A Temple To The Goddess. However, Fighting Is Not The Only Forte Of Tansen Residents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Jamre Folk Song Performance Of The Magars Are Colorful. Dancing And Feasting Are Accompanied By Drumbeats Of The Madal During Festivals. Amar Singh Thapa, Another Great Champion Of The Anglo-Nepal War, Had Great Affinity For Tansen As Well. He Brought Highly Skilled Artisans From Kathmandu Valley To Build The Amar Narayan Temple When He Was The Governor Of The Town. The Temple's Woodcarvings Are Remarkable And Puja Is Offered Here Everyday To Lord Bishnu.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During The Time Of The Rana Prime Ministers, From 1846 To 1951, Tansen Became An Important Outpost. Those Who Offended The Administration Or Were Political Prisoners Were Sent Away From The Kathmandu Valley Beyond Tansen. It Was Thought That They Would Not Be Able To Cause Problems To The Rulers From Their Faraway Exiles. Later The Ranas Tried To Develop Tansen Into A Hill-Station And Built Palaces And Mansions For Personal Use. One Such Palace In The Heart Of The Town Has A Huge Door Called The Baggi Dhoka. Some Say That It Was Built So That Khadga Shumsher Rana Would Not Need To Get Off' His Elephant While Entering The Palace. Others Claim That It Was Built So That Horse Drawn Chariots Could Easily Enter The Palace Grounds. The Town's Intricately Patterned Dhaka Is The Most Popular Handwoven Cloth Of Nepal. Newar Women Of The Kathmandu Valley Have Preferred Its Shawls For Many Decades. Nepal's National Cap, The Topi, Is Also Made Of Dhaka. Dhaka Is Available To Buyers At The Town's Bazaars. Those Interested May Also See Weavers At Work On Their Looms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There Are Potters And Metal Workers In Tansen Too. Earthen Pottery Is Still Used In Many Houses Of Tansen. Jugs, Basins, And Even Filters Are Made From Clay For Local Use. Chang, The Local Liquor, Is Wonderfully Cool If It Has Been Stored In Earthen-Ware. Metal Workers Make Deep Plates, Karuwa Water Jugs, Utensils For Worship And Hookahs For Smoking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tansen Is Charming Because It Is Unspoiled By Modernity, Pollution And Urban Bustle. On Clear Days, Mountain Views From The Town Reveal Dhaulagiri, Annapurna, Manaslu, Gauri Shankar And Other Peaks And A Walk Up To Srinagar Hill Provides An Even More Thrilling Himalayan Panorama.
