        You Don't Have To Be In Switzerland To Ride On Cable Cars. One Of The Best Ways To Experience The Panoramic Views That Darjeeling Is So Famous For, Is By Taking A Ride On The Ropeway. It's Also Called The Rangeet Valley Cable Car Because Of The Spectacular View Of The Valley Around The River Little Rangeet. You Will Need To Board The Cable Car From Singamari Which Is Some 3km Away From Darjeeling Chowk Bazaar. As You Ride The Cable Car, In About 45 Minutes You Will Travel From An Altitude Of About 7,000 Ft. Down To 800 Ft. Where The Last Station Singla Bazaar Is Located.

Starting With Just One Cable Car Or A Carriage, It Was Upgraded To Accommodate 16 Cable Cars Each Having A Capacity Of Six Persons.
