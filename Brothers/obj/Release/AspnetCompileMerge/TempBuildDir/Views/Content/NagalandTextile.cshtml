    <p>
     The Head Hunting Pattern Adorning Body Cloths Has Now Become Redundant With The Cessation Of The Practice.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Production Of Textiles Is Preserved By Naga Women. Both Cotton And Hemp Are Used To Make Naga Throws On Hand Looms, Using The Back-Strap Method. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After The Hand Spun Cloth Has Been Woven, Small Patches Of Embroidery Are Added Using A Porcupine Needle. A Number Of Plant Extracts Are Used To Dye The Cloth Including Indigo, Mahogany And Lacquer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Men And Women Wear Body Cloths Rich In Colour And Design, Each Tribe Having Its Own Particular Patterns.
    </p>

            Both Men And Women Are Very Fond Of Ornaments And Wear A Wide Range Of Adornments Including Bronze And Brass Armlets And Anklets, Heavy Earrings, Necklaces In Bronze, Shells, Precious Stones And Boar Tusks.
    </p>
    <p>
        For The Naga, Ornaments Are About More Than Mere Decoration; They Help Form The Identity Of The Individual And The Tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Men Also Wear Strong Metal Ornaments For Self Defence. Cane Or Brass Rings Are Worn Below The Knees To Provide Strength In Climbing Hills. Women Wear Necklaces Of Polished Hexagonal Cornelian Beads And For The Wealthy, Red Pebbles. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Nagas Believe Ornaments Were An Important Part Of What Defines A Human. Most Ornaments And Motifs Appearing On Textiles Have A Specific And Powerful Symbolic Meaning And The Right To Wear Them Is Strictly Governed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In A Fast Changing World, Naga Society Has Undergone Considerable Change Over The Last Few Decades. Nagaland Is Evidently Pursuing A Policy Of Economic And Social ‘Modernization’ And Ancient Traditions Are Quickly Falling By The Way. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Ninety Percent Of Naga Today Are Baptist Christians, With Just A Few Pockets Of Determined Animists. Western Experts On The Naga Caution Against The View Of The Naga As Passive Victims Of ‘De-Culturation’ And Stress That A Vigorous Sense Of History And Identity At An Individual And Tribal Level Has Been Retained. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately The Fight To Establish Independence By Some Naga Has Resulted In Division And Conflict Between Tribes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Naga Tradition Of Weaving By Offering Their Unique Textiles Are Limited In Supply, And While Designs And Colours Peculiar To Each Tribe Recur, Throws And Runners Are Often Unique And Exact Replicas Cannot Be Found. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Naga Textiles And Ornaments Are Indeed Very Well Crafted And Resonate With The Primal Quality Of An Ancient, Tribal Culture.
