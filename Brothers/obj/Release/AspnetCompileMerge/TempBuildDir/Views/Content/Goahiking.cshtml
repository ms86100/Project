        It May Be Difficult To Tear Yourself Away From The Idyllic Waters, But Heading Inland For Some Trekking Gives You A Glimpse At A Side Of Goa Many Visitors Overlook. One Of The Best Hikes, Especially If You’re Visiting Just After Monsoon Season From October To December, Is At The Impressive Dudhsagar Falls, Where The Water Cascades Down The Four Tiered Fall From Over 1,000 Feet (305 Meters) Above.
