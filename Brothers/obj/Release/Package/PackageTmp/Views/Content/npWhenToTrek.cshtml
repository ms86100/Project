        Although Trekking In Nepal Can Be Organized Throughout The Year, October Through May Are Considered To Be The Best Months For Trekking. Summer Months Of The Year Which Coincides With Monsoon Begins In Mid-June And Drains In Mid-September Making Travel Wet And Warm. The Mountain Views May Not Be At Their Best As Rain Clouds And Haze Over Hang The Mountains Occasionally Obscuring The Enchanting Views. These Times Are Blessed For The Keen Botanist As The Higher Valleys And Meadows Blossom With Flowers And Lush Vegetation. During Monsoon It Does Not Mean That It Will Rain Every Day. Besides, Some Of The Most Frequented Trails Will Not Be Crowded And Some People Like It That Way. It Can Actually Be Enjoyed In The Upper Part Of The Annapurna Circuit Around Marfa, Jomsom And Muktinath As The Monsoon Does Not Get In This Trans- Himalayan Area.
