        There Are Authorized Foreign Exchange Dealers In Most Cities, And Banks Will Also Change Your Currency At A Fair Rate If You Have Time For The Paperwork. A Good Way Of Getting Your Travelers Currency Is Via An ATM But Beware Of Hidden Bank Charges, Both From The Bank Providing The ATM And The Card-Issuing Bank - You Also Don't Know What Exchange Rate You're Getting. As With Any Country, It's Not A Good Idea To Rely Solely On Taking Your Bank Card As, If This Gets Lost Or Stolen, You Could Be Stuck Without Funds Far From Home. Travel Insurance Tends To Insure You Only For £200-Worth Of Lost Currency.
