        While Most Other States In India Are Gradually Moving Away From Their Traditional Agriculture Based Economy Toward Industry Or Service Oriented Economy, Assam Is Still Heavily Dependent On The Agricultural Sector. Compared To Most Other States In India, Assam Is Considered A Less Developed State, Which Depicts A Gloomy Picture The Economic Condition Of The State Given That India Is Considered A Less Developed Country (LDC). While The Socio Political Problems Afflicting The State Since The Last Few Decades Are Partly To Blame For A Lack Of Conducive Environment For Economic Development Of The State, Particularly In Industry Or Service-Oriented Areas, There Are Various Economic Reasons (E.G., Fragmented Land) Responsible For The Lagging Agricultural Sector In The State.
