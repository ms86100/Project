        The Basic Governmental Structure Of Mizoram, Like That Of Most Other Indian States, Is Determined By The National Constitution Of 1950. The Governor, Appointed By The President Of India, Is The Head Of State And Is Assisted By The Chief Minister, The Council Of Ministers, And The Unicameral Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha). The State Is Divided Into Several Administrative Districts, Each Headed By A Deputy Commissioner. The State Is Served By The High Court Of Guwahati (Assam), And There Is A Permanent Bench In Aizawal. Lower Courts Include District Council And Village Courts. In Mizoram, The Judiciary Is Not Separate From The Executive Branch Of Government.
