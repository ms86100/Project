            In The 12th And 13th Centuries, Gradual Contacts With The Ahoms Of Present Day Assam Was Established But Did Not Have Any Significant Impact On The Traditional Naga Way Of Life. However, In The 19th Century The British Appeared On The Scene And Ultimately The Area Was Brought Under British Administration. After Independence This Territory Was Made A Centrally Administered Area In 1957 Administered By The Governor Of Assam. It Was Known As The Naga Hills Tuensang Area. This Failed To Quell Popular Aspirations And Unrest Began. Hence, In 1961, The Area Was Renamed As Nagaland And Given The Status Of The State Of The Indian Union, Which Was Formally Inaugurated On 1 December 1963.
