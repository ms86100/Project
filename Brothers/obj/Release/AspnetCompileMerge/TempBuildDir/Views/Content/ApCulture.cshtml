        The Tribal People Of Arunachal Have Remained More Or Less Untouched By Modernity And Prefer To Adhere To Their Indigenous Laws And Culture. The Tribes Are Predominantly Casteless And Governed By Chiefs And Adults Of Their Clan. The Tribes Have Grown In Isolation And Have Not Been Influenced By Each Other’s Practices. The Common Denominator Is That The Young Follow The Diktat Of The Older Generation And Implement Their Decisions. Birth, Death And Marriage Are Big Social Occasions And Incomplete Without The Blessings Of The Elders.     </p>
    <p>
        The Entire Population Of The State Can Be Divided Into Three Cultural Groups On The Basis Of Their Socio-Politico-Religious Affinities. The First Of These Groups Includes The Buddhist Tribes; The Second Occupies The Central Part (From East Kameng In The West To Lohit In The East); And The Third Group Lives In The Southeastern Part Of The State.    </p>

        The People Of Arunachal Make Beautiful Masks And Periodically Stage Pantomimes And Masked Dances. They Specialize In Carving Semi-Religious Motifs On Wood And Make Exquisite Carpets, Painted Wooden Vessels And Silver Articles. They Are Expert Workers In Cane And Bamboo And Weave Articles That They Commonly Use In Their Daily Lives Like Shawls, Jackets, Shoulder Bags And Coats.    </p>
   <p>
            Specific Tribes Have Crafts Exclusive To Their Area Of Expertise - The Monpas Weave Carpets And Make Wooden Vessels. Apatanis, Adis And Hill Miris Make Bamboo Products And The Wanchos Carve Wooden And Bamboo Figures And Design Intricate Necklaces Of Colourful Beads. The Status Of The Bead-Wearer Is Indicated By The Width Of His/Her Necklace.    </p><p>
