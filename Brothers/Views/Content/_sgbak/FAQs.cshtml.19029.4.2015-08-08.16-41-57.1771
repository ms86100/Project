                    <p>
                        The incoming passengers are met just outside the arrival lounge of the airport as the government regulations do not allow hosts to enter the airport.

                        Our representative can be identified easily having the passengers placard displaying the name of the group (individuals in case of FITs).

                        We provide separate transfer by separate private vehicles to our different clients coming at the same time. The passengers have to wait for a few minutes till our vehicle waiting for them arrives at the spot from the parking place.

                    <p>
                        As the guests can meet our representative only outside the arrival lounge, they have to carry their luggage in the trolleys through the customs upto the exit point on their own and can hand over the same
                        to our representative after meeting him. He takes care of their luggage till they check in at the hotel.

                        Our fleet consists of vehicles of Indian make cars, Maruti Vans & Hard Top Covered Jeeps coaches. The type of vehicle provided for a
                        particular transfer depends upon the request and contract made between the two parties (Brother's & clients/agent on behalf of the clients) and the size and strength of the arriving group.

                        During their transfer from the airport to the hotel, the tourists are generally briefed on India and if time permits, on tourist destination(s). The transfer is not an orientation tour of the city.

                    <p>
                        If you enjoy a day's walking and can walk up and down hills, you will be fine. If you participate in any sport, you will be fine. The trek has an easy
                        grading although everyone will be out of breath at times. We would suggest some program of exercise starting one to two months prior to your arrival in
                        India. Step classes/stair master best prepare one for the hills.

                    <p>
                        Up to a maximum of 5-6 hours a day with lunch breaks along the trail. The maximum altitude reached during
                        the trek will be 7,000 feet or 2,100 meters. Altitude sickness will not affect you at these heights as it is only a concern above 10,000 feet or
                        3,000 meters. However, everyone suffers shortness of breath on some uphill sections.

                    <p>
                        You will require a light weight pair of boots that have rubber soles with thick tread and good ankle

                        A general idea will be: <br>
                        Breakfast : Cereal/Muesli/Porridge/Eggs/Tomatoes/Toast/Jam/Honey/Tea/Coffee.<br>
                        Lunch : Salad/Spring Rolls/Pizza/Quiche.<br>

                        Consult your local doctor who will have an updated list. However, most important are Gamma Globulin (for Hepatitis) and Tetanus. Do not go over the top
                        otherwise you will end up cholera, rabies, malaria tablets and many others. In case, it is always worth
                        talking to two doctors and then using your own judgement.

                        On trek, if you are not feeling well we make neccesscary ( potter / guide ) arrangements and will be made to descends to the nearest road where you will be met by our office staff and taken to the
                        nearest hospital if necessary a helicopter will be summoned as per the availability. You will then be flown with your guide. If necessary, an onward
                        International medical flight will be arranged in consult with the concerned embassy. Anywhere else on the trip, you will be taken by road to nearest

                        <b>About the river:</b><br>
                        It is an excellent introduction to rafting. There is only 1 grade III rapid and about 5 to 6 grade II rapids. For those who are already experienced, they
                        can try guiding or our guide can aim to get you wet.

                        You will need very little during the activity phases of the holiday : says USD 200 This should be carried in small denominations as change is hard to come by
                        in the villages. There are good deals to be found on the ways, on jewelry especially. However, when shopping in town, there are many items to buy (wall hangings, carvings, artifacts, clothes, etc.) Credit
                        cards are only accepted in some shops. <br>
                        <b>Electricity:</b><br>
                        The current is 220V/50 cycles and is available in India. Sockets have either three round pairs or two thick round pains. If you are traveling with electrical appliance, an international converter kit
                        and a set of adapter plugs will be required. Alternatively, it is more practical to travel with battery-operated appliance, where possible. While on
                        trek, you can recharge your batteries in some lodges as they use generators. However, no electricity is available on the river while rafting. <br>
