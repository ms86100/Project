        The people of Meghalaya are famous for their weaving skills and creating cane mats, stools, and baskets. They make a special kind of cane mat called tlieng, which guarantees a good utility of around 20-30 years. The Garos weave the material used for their costumes called the dakmanda. Khasis and Jaintias also weave cloth. The Khasis have also been involved in extracting iron ore and manufacturing domestic knives, utensils and even guns and other warfare weapons.
