        Bring Your Essential Medication, But Be Selective About Taking Other Medicines Along With You. Many Brands Can Be Purchased Without Prescription In India. But Whatever Your Medical Background, Do Not Treat Local People. Except In Extreme Emergencies, You Will Do More Harm Than Good. Supplying Antibiotics May Seem Helpful, But It May Discourage The Patient From Seeking Long-Term Advice From A Local Medical Practitioner.
