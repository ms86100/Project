        Then There Are Fast Food Outlets And Other Cheaper Restaurants Where If Local Ethnic Foods Are Tried, The Taste May Be More Genuine Than In The Very Expensive Hotels. One Example Is The "Momo", Which Is Never Quite The Same In Star Hotels. These Have To Be Tried In Places Frequented By The Local People. The Same Holds True For Chhang Or Tongba If At All They Are Served In Fancy Restaurants. A Few Guidebooks Will Advise You To Stay Away From Such Brews But Many Tourists Try Them Anyway. Some Restaurants Especially The Domino’s Have Started Home Delivery Service At No Extra Charge.
