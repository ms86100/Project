        Arunachal Pradesh Has A Fascinating Diversity Of Habitats Within Its Borders, Thanks To A Range Of Elevations From River Valleys And Subtropical Rainforests Lower Down To Verdant Wooded Ridges In The Middle And Higher Reaches, And Alpine Pastures And Snow Topped Peaks In The Uplands. This Remote State Gets Even More Remote The Further West You Go, The Valleys And Hills Ascending To Glaciers And Little Known Peaks Extending To Beyond 20,000Ft. (Approx. 6000m), Only Gori Chen (21286Ft, 6488m) And Nyegi Kangsang (23120Ft, 7047m), Both A Small Distance Away From Bomdila, Have Been Attempted.
