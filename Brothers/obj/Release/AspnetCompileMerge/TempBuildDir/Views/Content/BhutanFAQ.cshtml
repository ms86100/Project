    <b>Where Is Bhutan?</b>
    <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
        Tucked Away In The Folds Of The Mighty Eastern Himalayas Is Bhutan, A Small Buddhist Kingdom. The Tibetan Autonomous Region Of China Is In The North, Sikkim Is In The West, West Bengal And Assam Comprise Its Southern Borders And Arunachal Pradesh Is In The East. The Total Area Of Bhutan Is 47000 Sq Kms.
    </p>
    <b>Why Is Bhutan A "Must Do " Destination For Indian Tourists?</b>
    <p>
        It Remains One Of The Most Exclusive Tourist Destinations In The World Today. Every Year About 5,000 Foreign Tourists (The Number Is Strictly Regulated By The Tourism Authority Of Bhutan-TAB) From All Corners Of The Globe Pay Upwards Of US$200 A Day To Visit This Enchanting Kingdom. This Is In Accordance With The Government's Policy Of Restricted Tourism Intended To Protect The Nation's Rich Culture And Tradition And It's Fragile Environment. The Same, However, Does Not Apply To Indians With Whom Bhutan Boasts A Relationship That Dates Back To The 50's When Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Made A Historic Trip On Yak Back. Indians Are Required To Pay Actuals, A Rate Far Below Those Charged To Foreigners For The Same Facilities. In Other Words, The Cost Of Travel Can Be About The Same As A Trip To Any Other Indian Hill Station.

    <b>Which Is The Best Time To Visit Bhutan?</b>
    <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
        Every Season In Bhutan Has It's Own Charm. Autumn Is A Lovely Season When The Skies Are Blue, The Air Is Fresh After The Rains, The Trees Are Shedding Their Leaves Creating A Kaleidoscope Of Colours. Winters Are Very Cold And In Most Parts Of Bhutan Eg. Paro, Thimphu , Dochula Pass, Bumthang Etc., It Snows. It Is A Fabulous Season If You Can Bear The Cold. The Summers Are As It Should Be - Very Pleasant. The Skies Are Clear With Occasional Rains To Clear The Air. Foreigners Visit Bhutan Mainly To See The Religious Festivals (Or Tsechus) Performed In The Various Monasteries. These Festivals Coincide With The Autumn And Summer Season. So, Accommodation Is Tight And One Should Book In Advance. Indians Prefer Going As Per The Climatic Seasons.
    </p>
    <b>How Many Days Are Enough For A Holiday In Bhutan?</b>
    <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
        This Depends On The Places That You Want To Cover. If You Are Looking For A Very Short Break, A 3 Night-4 Day Vacation Covering Paro And Thimphu Would Suffice. A 7 Night - 8 Day Package Would Cover Paro, Thimphu, Punakha And Wangdiphodrang. However, If You Have Enough Time On Your Hands And Wish To Cover The Whole Of Bhutan, Then 12 Nights Would Be Needed. You May Enter From Paro Or Phuntsholing In The West And Exit From Samdrup, Jonkhar In The East. From Samdrup, Guwahati Is Only 110kms (3hrs) Away.
    </p>
    <b>Which Areas Can I Visit In Bhutan?</b>

    <b>How Good Are The Hotels In Bhutan?</b>
    <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
        The Hotels We Deal With Are Some Of The Finest In The Region. However, One Must Understand That Bhutan Is Still Emerging As A Tourist Destination And Facilities At All Hotels, Though Not Luxurious, Are Comfortable And Adequate. Some Of The Hotels Like Olathang And Kichu Resort In Paro And Hotel Zangthopelri In Punakha Have Rooms Scattered In A Sprawling Campus And Room Service Is Not Encouraged. Service In The Restaurants Is Faster And The Food Warmer.
    </p>
    <b>What Are The Roads Like?</b>
    <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
        The Roads In Paro, Thimphu, Punakha And Wangdi Are Very Good. In Central Bhutan, Some Patches On The Trongsa To Yotongla Pass Section (Before Bumthang ) Are In Need Of Minor Repairs Which Are Carried Out Regularly. Unlike Sikkim, Landslides Are Not So Common Here.

    <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
        Most Tourists Are Awed By The Dzongs And Monasteries With Their Unique Medieval Architectural Design Which Usually Doesn't Have A Plan And Nails Are Not Used In The Construction. Bhutanese Dzongs Are Versatile Buildings: Fortress, Monastery And Town Hall Under One Roof. An Example Of This Is The Capital's Grand 17th Century Tashichhodzong Which Functions As A Royal Palace, Parliament Building And The Epi-Centre Of The Country's Religious Life. Entry To Dzongs And Monasteries Is Presently Restricted.
    </p>
    <b>Which Dzongs And Monasteries Can We Enter?</b>

Their National Dish, Hemadatshi, Is Made Entirely Of Chillies (Hema) Treated As A Vegetable And Served In A Cheese (Datshi) Sauce! If Cooked Properly It Is Delicious. Pork And Beef Are Easily Available. Drinking Water Should Be Consumed Only At Good Hotels. Mineral Water Is A Safer Bet.

All Men And Women Must Wear Their Traditional Dresses Called The 'Gho' And 'Kira' Respectively. Their National Sport Is Traditional Archery. Their Definition Of 'Progress' Is Different From Ours. Only That Technology From The Outside World Is Imported That Blends With Their Lifestyle Without Jeopardising Their Rich Cultural Heritage.
