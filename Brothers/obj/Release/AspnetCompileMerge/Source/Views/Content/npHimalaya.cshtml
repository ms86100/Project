            It Is A Very Interesting Thing To Know That There Was A Sea (The Tethys Sea) Between Indian Gondwana Continent (Indian Sub-Continent And Eurasian Continent). Around 70 And 80 Million Years Ago, The Himalaya Began To Come Into Existence. It Is A Peak Of Each Evolution Only About 10 To 20 Million Years Back. Therefore, The Himalaya Is Extremely Young And Geologically Active. According To Geologists, Mountains Are Growing At A Rate Of 15 Cm (6 Inch) A Year As The Indian Plate Is Moving Northward And Forcing Under The Eurasian Plate. This Process (Plate Tectonics) Causes The Earthquakes In This Region. Geologists Say That The Collision Of Continents Is Squeezing Up Sedimentary Rocks That Were Once Below The Sea. The Mountains Of Himalaya Are The Result Of The Collision Of Continents.
