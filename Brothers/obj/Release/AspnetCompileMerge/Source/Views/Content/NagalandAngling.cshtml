        The Main Rivers That Flow Through Nagaland Are Dhansiri, Doyang, Dikhu And Jhanji. Milak River And Tula River Flowing In Mokokchung District Of Nagaland Serve As Exciting Angling Spots For Keen Anglers. You Can Find A Variety Of Fish Species Like The Famous Indian Mahseer, Local Trout, Salmon Etc. You Can Hire The Fishing Equipments Like Fishing Rods And Nets, Hooks, Bait Etc From The Shops Near The Rivers And Lakes Or Even Arrange Them From Your Tour Operator At Very Reasonable Charges. One Should Avoid Fishing Alone Especially During The Night Time As It Is Not Advised To Go Without A Local Guide And A Guide Map Of That Particular Area.
