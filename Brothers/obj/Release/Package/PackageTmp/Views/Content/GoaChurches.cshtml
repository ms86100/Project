        For Those Of You Who Thought That Goa Is Only Famous For Its Serene Beaches, Here's Something Different. Goa Is Also Known For Its Magnificent Churches Which Were Built By The Portuguese In The 17th And 18th Century.

    </p>
    <p>
        The Portuguese Arrived In Goa, With The Dual Intention Of Controlling The Spice Route From The East And Propagating Christianity. Initially, The Churches Built By Them Played A Major Role In Attracting People Towards Christianity But Today, With A Significant Christian Population, These Churches Are Playing An Important Role In Goa's Religious, Cultural And Social Framework.

        Goan Churches Are Also Known For Their Excellent Architecture, Which Is An Interesting Blend Of Two Or More Architectural Styles. The Architects Responsible For The Construction Of The Goan Churches Were Inspired By The Italian Architects As Such Imitations Of The Roman Churches Which Had A Touch Of The Renaissance With Baroque Interior, Sprang Up. Over The Years, A Significant Change Has Been Witnessed In The Architecture Of The Churches, However, The Goan Churches Built During The Portuguese Rule Are Still Noted For Their Unique Architectural Features
