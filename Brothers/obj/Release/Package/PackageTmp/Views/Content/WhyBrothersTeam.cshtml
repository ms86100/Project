    <h4 class="text-primary">Our Packages Prices</h4>
    <p>
        We Have Almost Given Up Trying To Publish Package Prices For Our Packages Programs Online Since They Have Become So Complicated That You <b>Practically Need A Manual</b> To Understand Them. We Have Options In Different Price In Each Package. Prices Are Not Only Seasonal But Are Frequently Reduced Or Increased Whimsically By All Related Components For Reasons That Are Never Clear To Us. <b>The Result Is Dozens Of Different Prices Based On The Packages Chosen.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        We Do Not Like The Idea Of Buying A Holiday From A Catalog, Then Being Herded Around According To A Strict Itinerary And Schedule. Your Holiday <b>Should Be As Individual As You Are</b>, And A Reflection Of Your Lifestyle And Your Personal Interests. This Is Why Everyone's Traveling With Brothers’ Experience Is Different From Every Other Guests.

        Even Great Cooks Appreciate A Dinner In A Fine Restaurant Where A Chef Does All The Shopping, Slicing, Dicing, Cooking And Dish Washing. In A Restaurant, You Can Relax And Spend Your Time Enjoying The Company And Food. When You Leave The Job To Reputable Kitchen Staff You Usually End Up With A Meal That Is More Enjoyable Than One You Might Prepare Yourself. <b>Using A Professional Planner Is Much The Same</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We Do Not Normally Write Proposals Or Quote Prices For The Simple Reason That Each Of The Packages Described On Our Website Are, In Themselves, A Proposal, And Prices Are Published Online As Well, We Offer. If You Need Help With A <b>Custom-Planned Itinerary</b>, We Are Ready To Assist You.<a href="@Url.Action("tourpackages","tripplanner")"> View our Package Page for details</a>

        Arrival And Departure Transportation And Your Hotel, Touring With A Carefully Chosen, A Private Vehicle And Familiar Driver On Most Of Our Tours And Often Extras Like Special Meals.
        It Is Even More <b>Complicated If You Add Nights Or Modify The Itinerary</b>. We Have Thought About Quoting Prices As "$Xxxx And Up" Followed By An Asterisk And Some <b>Tiny Print At The Bottom Of The Page</b>. However, We Do Not Want To Seem To Use "Bait And Switch" Tactics So We Do Not Publish Prices We Will Not Be Able To Live With.

    <h4 class="text-primary">Looking For A Cheap Holiday Maker</h4>
    <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
        So You Are <b>Looking For A Cheap Holiday Maker</b>
        Here Is What You Need To Know First.<br />
        Travel Advice For The Foothills Of The Himalaya India Tour ? <b>What You Need To Know Before You Buy A Cheap Tour</b>.<br />
        So You Are Looking <b>For A Great Bargain Price</b>.
        Here Is Some Advice To Keep In Mind Before When Searching For A Cheap Tour And Choosing <b>The Tour That Is Right For You</b>.
    </p>
    <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
        <b>Major Differences Between A Fantastic Tour And A Mediocre One</b><br />
    </p>
    <b>Hotels</b>
    <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
        There Are A Couple Of Really Good Hotels In This Sector And A Lot Of Bad Ones, And Very Little In Between. The Result Is Staggering Hotel Prices Comparable To Other Sector In Himalaya.
        A Peculiar Star Rating System For Hotels That Somehow Awards Five Stars To Hotels That Would Not Receive Three Stars Elsewhere.
        Some Hotels ("Lodges") Do Not Get Star Ratings At All So Top Hotels Are Not Always Comparable To Each Other.
        While We Do Not Put A Lot Of Confidence In The Advice Given In Most Guide Books, There Are Websites That Show Candid Photos Of Hotels And Publish Comments From Guests. If <b>Your</b> Tour Company Suggests Hotels That Are Not Mentioned Anywhere Online, That's <b>A Bad Sign As Well</b>.
        Price Is Not Always A Reliable Gauge Of Quality In This Sector. We Have Heard Plenty Of Stories About (And Even Seen) About Stinky $Xxrs Hotel Rooms With Dirty Sheets, That Have Not Been In Order For Long. One Towel For Two People To Share, Furniture With Cigarette Burns, And Bathroom Sinks That Drain.
        <b>Yet We Have Also Enjoyed Delightful Hotels That We Would Love To See Again</b>.
        One Of The Most Wonderful Things About A Journey Through Is That You Also Have A Chance To Stay In This <b>Fascinating Hotel</b>. A Program That Misses Such Opportunities May Cost Less But You Will Miss Truly Memorable Cultural Experiences In The Process.
        An Itinerary That Does Not Name Specific Hotels Or States "<b>Xyz Hotel Or Similar</b>" Is A Sign Of A Cheap Tour Leading To Disaster.
        <b>You Can Not Rely On Cheap Standards</b>.
    </p>
    <b>Itineraries:</b>
    <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
        The Right Itinerary Can Easily Mean The Difference Between A Great Trip And A Disastrous One, So It Pays To Be Cautious About What You Are Offered.
        Above All, Resist The Temptation <b>To Try To Do To Much In Too Little Time</b> Or You May End Up With What We Call A <b>"Drive By" Tour</b>. Well, Technically It Is Possible To Drive From Gangtok To A Point And See The Place Just Before Dark. Or Try To See All Of Everything In A Single Day Or Be Dragged Through Places So Fast You Barely Remember Being There. We Have Seen Itineraries That Are Virtually Impossible To Accomplish. A Cheap Agent Usually Has No Way To Know What Is Possible And What Is Not.
        Incidentally, We Think The Itineraries On Our Website Offer The Optimum Amount Of Time To Travel From Place To Place And See Things Comfortably, So We Hope You Will Compare Our Itinerary With Others You Receive.
        Your Itinerary Should Include The Places You Want To See. While This Sounds A Bit Ridiculous, Cheap Tour Agent May Actually Skip Places.
        <br />
        If You Expect A Custom Tour You Should Actually Be Able To Customize It And Not Just Choose Between A Series Of Sample Itineraries That Are Not Exactly What You Want.
        Even If The Itinerary Looks Great, Will It Actually Be Followed? Sadly, Some Companies In Our Industry, Particularly In One-Time Destinations Like This, Do Not Follow Their Own Programs Carefully. Once They Have Your Money And Put Your Body In Their Vehicle You Do Not Have Much Choice But To Go Along. They Are Used To Hearing Arguments From Tour Members And They Have A Lot Of Experience Feigning Deafness.
    </p>
    <b>Ground Operations</b>
    <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
        "Ground Operations" Includes Guides, Drivers, Vehicles And Those <b>Odds And Ends</b> That Are Or Should Be Included In A Tour.
    </p>
    <b>Guides</b>
    <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
        Practically All Tour Operators In North Sikkim Use Drivers As An Escort & Guide
        You Can Use Local Guides, Which Means You Will Have One Guide In North Sikkim And A Different Guide In Other Parts. You Can Usually Arrange To Have A Single Guide Throughout, Although That Increases The Cost Substantially And That Guide May Not Be As Familiar With A City As A Local Person.
        Many Cheap Tour Companies Use Inexperienced Guides Who Lack The Training And Experience Of A Guide. Guides That Are Frequently Stopped And Ejected At Places. This Can Be Both Embarrassing And Inconvenient In Addition To A Waste Of Money.
    </p>
    <b>Vehicles</b>
    <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
        Make Sure Your Tour Will Use Late Model Vehicles. Some Vehicles Are Much Smaller Than It Is Used To, So It Pays To Confirm The Make, Model And Age Of The Car You Will Be Getting. Cars Used For Tourism Require Special Permits. Some Tour Operators Cut Corners By Using Unregistered Vehicles. If Noticed By The Authorities, Drivers And Passengers Are Temporarily Stranded. You Definitely Do Not Want To Watch The Road Speed By Through The Rust Holes In The Floor.
    </p>
    <b>Hidden Costs</b>
    <p class="row-margin-bottom-20">
        Are A Major Scam Some Cheap Tour Operators Use To Make You Think Their Prices Are Very Low. Make Sure You Get A Written Statement From Cheap Tour Handling People About What Is And Is Not Included Cheap Tour. Exactly Which Hotel And What Kind Of Room? How About Breakfast? Admissions Costs? Road Tolls? Special Transportation? Just Because Your Tour Includes Entry To The Restricted Areas, Does It Also Include The Vehicle Jeep Necessary To Take You Around? Are Permission To The Places You Will Visit Also Included? How About The Cost Of Overnight Accommodations For The Driver Escort Or Guide? Of Not, You Will Be Digging Into Your Pocket Quite A Bit While Enjoying Your Cheap Cheap Tour.

    <h4 class="text-primary">Services</h4>
    <p>
        What Happens Before You Travel Plays A Big Part In The Success Of The Trip. Responsiveness And Willingness To Answer Any And All Questions Are Both Essential. Incomplete Or Evasive Answers To Your Questions Are A Bad Sign.
        Cheap Operator Should Be Flexible Enough To Make Small Changes In Your Program As Long As They Are Not Done At The Last Minute, And Not Requested Every Time You Read A Story In A Travel Magazine Or Meet Someone At A Party Who Went To This Areas Once And Wants You To Take A Trip Exactly The One They Took. When Unlimited Service Is Available It Will Not Be At A Bargain Price.
        The Way A Company Represents Itself Should Give You Important Insights Into What You Can Expect From Them. If They Promote Themselves As A <b>Cheap Tour Operator</b>, You Will Probably End Up With A Tour That Leaves You Wishing You Had Made A Different Choice. On The Other Hand, A Company With A Reputation For Producing A First Class Program And Is Proud To Share Feedback From Past Customers Will Probably Give You A Great Tour. Herein Lays The Big Difference Between Price And Value, As Well As The Difference Between "Them" And "Us." We Turn Down The Opportunities Some Customers Give Us To Compete With Budget Tour Companies Because We Are Not Interested In Putting Our Label On The Miserable, Cheap Tours That They Show Us. We Do Not Cut Corners Or Indulge In Deceptive Practices In Order To <b>Make One Sale</b>. Almost Most Of Our Customers Are Repeat Guests, Which Is Pretty Remarkable.
        The Service Should Not Stop Once The Tour Has Been Sold.
        Good Tour Companies Will Give You A Detailed Itinerary With Local Contacts Before Your Journey Begins, As Well As 24-Hour Numbers Where You Can Contact Them In Case Of A Problem. You Want To Make Sure The Numbers Actually Work, Of Course.
