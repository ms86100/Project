    <h4 class="text-info">Why Walking Tours….? </h4>
    <p>
        We Believe Walking Is The Best Way To See A Place. If You Drive, You Watch The Road. In A Taxi, The Places Moves Past Too Quickly. Riding A Bicycle Is Even Too Fast And Distracting.
        Walking Is The Only Way To Really Examine The People, The Culture, The Lifestyle, The Market, The Shops, The Art, And The Trash.
        The Only Way To Feel The Texture Of A City At Ground Level Is With Your Feet.
