        Goan Cuisine, With Its Manifold Combinations Of Coconut, Chillies, Vinegar, Rice And Spice, Is One Of The World’s Original Fusion Foods, Rich In Portuguese And South Indian Heritage. Goans Take The Sting Of Their Appetites Extremely Seriously: ‘Prodham Bhookt, Magi Mookt’, Say The Locals In Konkani ‘You Can’t Think Until You’ve Eaten Well’. Typically, Unlike In Much Of India, Goan Dishes Come With A Meaty Or Fishy Accent, The Most Delicious Of Which Are Set Aside For Feast Days, Saints’ Days And Weddings. Hunt About In Local Haunts, However, And Your Search Will Be Rewarded With Mouth-Watering Goan Curries Galore, Such As Xacutis (A Spicy Chicken Or Meat Dish Incorporating Coconut Milk), Vindaloos And Cafrials (Meat In A Spicy Sauce). Meanwhile, In The Sweet Department, Creations Are Cooked Up In Combinations Of Sugar, Cardamom, Coconut And Jaggery (Dark Palm Sugar) They’re Not Bikini-Conducive, But They Taste Divine.
