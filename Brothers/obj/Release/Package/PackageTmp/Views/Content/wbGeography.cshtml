        Most Of The State Lies On The Western Delta Of The Ganga. At The Eastern Part Of The Ganga Valley, The Great Alluvial Filled Trough Which Fronts The Himalayas Becomes Much Shallower. The Basalt Rajmahal Hills, In The Centre Of The State Are A Projection North East Of The Peninsula Rocks. Over, The Last 1000 Yeras, The Land Has Been Cleared And Now The Only Jungle That Remains Is In The Mangrove Swamps Of The Sunderbans In The Far South And On The Slopes Of The Himalayas In The North. In Other Places, The Flat Alluvial Plains Have Been Converted Into An Intensively Cultivated Rice Growing Landscape. The Coconut Fringed Village Ponds Break Up The Scenery And Villages Often Stand Surrounded By Orchards With Mangoes, Papayas And Palmyra Palms. The Ganga Delta Is Very Active And Rivers Continue To Change Their Course Frequently.
