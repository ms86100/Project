        Jammu And Kashmir Is Home To Two Main Fast Paced Rivers -River Indus And River Zanskar. These Two Rivers Make The Perfect Setting For White Water Rafting. Two Different Stretches Of River Lidder Near Pahalgam Are Great For Rafting For First Timers And Learners As The Slopes Are Not That Steep. Day Long Excursions To River Are Also Popular Among Tourists. Adventure Seekers Can Also Opt For White Water Canoeing In Rivers Like Suru, Drass And Sindh And In The Many High Altitude Lakes Like Vishensar, Gangabal And Kaunsarnag. Angling Is Another Fast Catching Up Sport In Jammu And Kashmir.
