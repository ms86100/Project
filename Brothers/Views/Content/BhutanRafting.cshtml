        Generally Rafting Conjures Of Images Of Crashing Through Horrendous Rapids And Monstrous Waves With Laughing And Screaming Joyful Rafters Hanging On But In The Context Of Rafting In Bhutan, It Is A Gentle Drift-Down-The-River Admiring The Scenery And Running A Few Small Yet Exciting Rapids.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Most Of The Rivers In Bhutan Are Very Steep And Highly Rushing With Limited Road Access Makes It Considerably Unsuitable For White Water Rafting. Only A Few Rivers Are Opened For Rafting Considering Their Safe Course And Easy Access.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Pho Chu, With Its  Approx 16 Km Course With About 15 Rapids Of Class 2-4 Is The Most Popular For Rafting In Bhutan Followed By Mo Chu River With 10 Km Course Comprising Around 10 Rapids With 2 -  2+ Rapids.

        Drifting Past Imposing 17th Century Punakha Dzong (Fort Cum Monastery) Watching World’s Rarest Bird, The White Belled Heron In Its Natural Habitat And Kingfishers Frolicking On Riverbank - All These Topped Off With Spectacular Sight Of Serene Lush Green Alpine Valleys, Are The Most Amazing Experience You Would Love To Treasure. Rafting In Bhutan Is A Superb Experience In Its Own Right.

    <p>
        No Special Experience Is Required As Long As You Do Not Mind Doing A Bit Of Paddling And Getting A Bit Wet - Or Quite Possibly Very Wet! - Then You Will Have An Exciting Time Riding The White Waters Of The Himalayan Rivers.
