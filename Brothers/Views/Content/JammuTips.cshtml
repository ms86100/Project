As Far As The Equipments Are Concerned, One Should Carry A Duffel Bag, As During Trekking, One Needs To Carry All His Goodies Along. The Bag Should Be Large Enough To Accommodate All Your Clothes And Toiletries And Of Course The Camera. Walking Sticks Also Prove Beneficial While Crossing Streams. Carry A Water Bottle And A Torch And An Umbrella, To Shield Yourself From The Rain And The Sun. While You Are On Your Trekking Campaign, Do Carry Cooking Utensils And Cooking Stove.
