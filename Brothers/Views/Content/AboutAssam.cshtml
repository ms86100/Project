        Occupying 2.39% Of India’s Landmass, Assam Is The Most Vibrant Of Eight States Comprising The Northeast. Bounded By These States, West Bengal, Bhutan And Bangladesh, Its Topographical Asymmetry Is Underscored By The Barail Hill Range Sandwiched Between Two Valleys – Brahmaputra And Barak – Named After The Dominant Rivers.

        Assam Is Synonymous With Breathtaking Natural Beauty, Teeming Wildlife, Immaculate Tea Gardens And Warm, Beautiful People. It’s Strategic Location In The Northeast Of India, And It’s Accessibility From The Rest Of The Country Makes It The Gateway To The Northeastern States.
