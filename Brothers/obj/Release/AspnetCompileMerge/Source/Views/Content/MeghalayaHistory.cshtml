        As The Legend Goes, There Were Originally 16 Families, Nine In Heaven And Seven On Earth. The Golden Vine That Connected Them Was Severed When Sin Polluted The Earth. From Then Onwards, The People Were Divided Into 16 Warring Families With Different Chiefs. These Families Belonged To The Khasi, Jaintia And Garo Tribes. Today, They Are The People Of Meghalaya And This Is Their Legendary Beginning! And They Do Fight Amongst Themselves Quite A Bit!    </p>
