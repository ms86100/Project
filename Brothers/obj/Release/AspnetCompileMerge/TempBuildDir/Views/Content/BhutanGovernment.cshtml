        In November 2001, On The Advice Of The Fourth King, A Committee Chaired By The Chief Justice Of Bhutan, Was Formed To Draft The Constitution Of Bhutan. The Constitution Was Launched In 2008 And With It A Parliamentary Democracy Introduced.

Thus, In 2008 Bhutan Witnessed A Major Shift In Its Political System With The First Elections Launched Country Wide.
