        Most Treks In Bhutan Are In High Altitude And So Most Trekkers Come In Spring Or Fall/Autumn. The High Tourist Season Is During The Period Of Best Weather In Autumn/Fall And In The Spring; That Is When You Will Probably Meet Several Other Trekkers On The Popular Routes.
        Late September To Mid-November Is Recognized As The Best Time For Trekking And Late March Till Mid May Is The Next Best Time For High Altitude Treks. Spring Is Best To See The Dazzling Variety Of Rhododendrons And Autumn Is More Favorable In Terms Of Temperature.

    <p>
        No Matter, When You Trek, You May Have Rain. During Autumn Or Fall, Nights Are Cold In The Mountains, But The Bright Sun Makes For Pleasant Daytime.
    </p>
    <p>
        If You Wish To See Alpine Flowers At Their Best You Will Have To Travel During The Wet Season (Mid June Till Late August). The Trails Are Muddy, Particularly Those Areas Below 2500m But Above Those Areas, There Is Less Rain And High Grasslands Are Filled With Alpine Blooms.
